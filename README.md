# Prep Baseball Report (PBR) 2019-2022 Recruiting Project

## Question: Which counties have produced the most top 100 California baseball recruits in the last 4 years? 

### This project was done to support the UCSB Baseball Analytics Team and the UCSB Baseball coaching staff in their recruiting efforts. The markdown file goes through my code. This was my first experience with web scraping using the _rvest_ package. Below is a summary of my work: 

- Recruiting data was scraped from Prep Baseball Report for each year
- Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties have produced the most top 100 recruits
- Most of the top recruits from California tend to be RHP or OF
- After much deliberation, I decided to visualize the data with a choropleth map for ease of interpretation
- Data scraped was not as clean as I wanted it to be. I suspect the cleaning process could have been made easier by writing functions or cleaning with Excel.
